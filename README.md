# Deployment

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

## Deploy on DigitalOcean

[![DigitalOcean](https://img.shields.io/badge/DigitalOcean-0080FF?style=flat&logo=digitalocean&logoColor=white)](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

1. sign up a free account with a $200 for 60 days trial and create a Kubernetes cluster in a new project on Digital Ocean

2. generate a new access token on Digital Ocean to connect with Digital Ocean via doctl, go to the _API_ menu then click _generate a new token_, set expiration date and enable both read and write scopes, copy the _token code_ for use in the next step

3. install [doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), then run
```
doctl auth init --access-token <API_TOKEN_CODE>
```

4. connect with Digital Ocean k8s cluster context by running this command and authorize with your credentials
```
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
``` 

5. switch Kubernetes context to the new context by running
```
kubectl config use-context <CONTEXT_NAME>
```

6. setup all Kubernetes secrets following [this step](#setup-kubernetes-secret)

7. create _GitHub _workflow_ for building an initial docker image on push event at the _main_ branch and perform automated testing in every service on pull request event trigger with trying to merge with the _main_ branch

```
name: deploy-client

on:
  push:
    # watch for pull request into main branch
    branches:
      - main

    # watch for changes in client folder
    paths:
      - "client/**"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # build an image
      - run: cd client && docker build -t <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME> .

      # login on docker hub
      - run: docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD
        env:
          DOCKER_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          DOCKER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      # push an image to docker hub
      - run: docker push <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>
```

8. generate another new access token on Digital Ocean for authentication via GitHub Action, go to the _API_ menu then click _generate a new token_, set expiration date and enable both read and write scopes, copy the _token code_ for use in the next step as a `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN` 

9. add GitHub action secrets for _docker credentials_ and _digitalocean access token key_ at the security setting in the repository
```
DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN = 
DOCKER_USERNAME = 
DOCKER_PASSWORD = 
```

10. edit files in every service then commit code to the _main_ branch for triggering **Github Action workflows** to build and push all images to your Docker Hub

11. install [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#digital-ocean) to automatically create **DigitalOcean Load Balancer**

12. separate k8s folder to k8s-dev and k8s-prod then copy `ingress-srv.yaml` file to both folders and edit the host URL to a new domain name

13. create a GitHub workflow for telling the Kubernetes cluster to use images we built by adding these lines

```
- uses: digitalocean/action-doctl@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
- run: doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
- run: kubectl rollout restart deployment <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
```

14. purchase a domain name with a promotion that can be very cheap as $1 for the 1st year such as Namecheap, Porkbun, or Dynadot

15. config custom domain name nameserver with your domain name registration website by custom adding these lines
```
ns1.digitalocean.com
ns2.digitalocean.com
ns3.digitalocean.com
```

16. add a domain name in the Digital Ocean at networking tab then create a new record

```
// A record
HOSTNAME: @
WILL DIRECT TO: <YOUR_LOAD_BALANCER>
TTL: 30

// CNAME record
HOSTNAME: www
IN AN ALIAS OF: @
TTL: 30
```

17. add your cluster name at `deploy-manifests.yaml` file then redo step 7. again

```
name: deploy-manifests

on:
  push:
    # watch for pull request into main branch
    branches:
      - main

    # watch for changes in infra folder
    paths:
      - "infra/**"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # use and cliententicate doctl
      - uses: digitalocean/action-doctl@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

      # use and cliententicate doctl
      - run: doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>

      # apply deployment yaml files (k8s-prod is for production!)
      - run: kubectl apply -f infra/k8s && kubectl apply -f infra/k8s-prod
```

18. change `do-loadbalancer-hostname` and `host` at file `infra/k8s-prod/ingress-srv.yaml` to your domain name

19. change the URL in `client/api/build-client.js` to your domain name

20. after that, we will follow step 4 of this guide [How to Set Up an Nginx Ingress with Cert-Manager on DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nginx-ingress-with-cert-manager-on-digitalocean-kubernetes) to make our website ready for **HTTPS** requests with the certificate issued by **Let's encrypt**

21. begin with installing the _cert-manager_ namespace by running the command
```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

22. change your directory to `infra/issuer/` there will be 2 files that you need to change the _email_ and _name of a secret key_ as you wish then run the command
```
kubectl create -f staging_issuer.yaml
``` 
```
kubectl create -f production_issuer.yaml
```

23. at file `infra/k8s-prod/ingress-srv.yaml` change _cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer_ to `"letsencrypt-staging"` then run this command at `infra/k8s-prod/` directory
```
kubectl apply -f ingress-srv.yaml
```

24. then change _cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer_ back to `"letsencrypt-prod"` and run this command at `infra/k8s-prod/` directory
```
kubectl apply -f ingress-srv.yaml
```

25. waiting around 2-15 minutes for setting up then browse your website with **HTTPS** protocol
